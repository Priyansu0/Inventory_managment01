We are developing a Python-based Inventory and Purchase Management System tailored for small businesses. The system should feature an intuitive and visually appealing Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using either Tkinter or PyQt5, incorporating a modern aesthetic with responsive layout, tabbed views, hover effects, icons, and both light and dark themes. The design should be user-friendly and visually engaging.
The core functionalities of the system should include:
1. Inventory Management Module
    * Capabilities to add, edit, and delete products
    * Set and monitor reorder levels
    * Track stock quantities in real-time
    * Display a clear view of all product data
2. Purchase Order Management
    * Create and manage purchase orders
    * Update inventory quantities upon receipt
    * Track pending and delivered orders efficiently
3. Supplier Management
    * Add, edit, and delete suppliers
    * Link suppliers to products
    * Store supplier contact information and assess performance
4. QR Code Integration
    * Automatically generate QR codes upon product or order creation
    * Enable QR scanning via webcam to instantly fetch and edit associated data
    * Connect physical inventory with digital records seamlessly
5. Dashboard and Reporting Tools
    * Show low-stock alerts and reorder notifications
    * Calculate total inventory valuation
    * Analyze purchase trends over time with interactive charts
    * Allow data exports to Excel or CSV formats
The system must be backed by a well-structured database using SQLite for development or PostgreSQL for production. The recommended schema includes tables for products, suppliers, purchase orders, and purchase items, each with appropriate foreign keys and indexing.
Key technologies and tools to be used include:
* Python
* SQLite/PostgreSQL for the database
* SQLAlchemy or Peewee for ORM
* qrcode[pil] for generating QR codes
* opencv-python and pyzbar for QR scanning
* pandas for data analysis
* matplotlib or plotly for visual reporting
* openpyxl or csv for export functionality
The system should follow a modular, object-oriented codebase with input validation, error handling, and an optimized UI/UX. Navigation should be smooth and the interface should allow users to switch between GUI and CLI modes if needed.
Optionally, the application may include a web interface built using Flask and Jinja2 templates for access across devices.
This project aims to deliver a robust, scalable, and user-centric solution for businesses to manage their inventory, suppliers, and purchasing processes effectively.
